                        <p>This is a program used to make a project we called snake. 
                            we used codes that are really easy to learn.Also The spelling
                            on this program is very sensitive so we had to be careful.
                            besides by one mispelled word the whole project wont work.</p>

                        <p>On this program the beginning was really difficult and confusing 
                            for me.later on our teacher helped the class and i started to
                            understand all i needed was  some help from students. </p>
